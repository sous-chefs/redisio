redisio CHANGE LOG
===

1.0.3 - Released 5/2/2012
---

  - Added changelog.md
  - Added a bunch more configuration options that were left out (default values left as they were before):  
      - databases
      - slaveservestaledata
      - replpingslaveperiod
      - repltimeout
      - maxmemorysamples
      - noappendfsynconwrite
      - aofrewritepercentage
      - aofrewriteminsize
      
      It is worth nothing that since there is a configurable option for conf include files, and the fact that redis uses the most recently read configuration option... even if a new option where to show up, or and old one was not included they could be added using that pattern.
