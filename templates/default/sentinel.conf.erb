# *** IMPORTANT ***
#
# By default Sentinel will not be reachable from interfaces different than
# localhost, either use the 'bind' directive to bind to a list of network
# interfaces, or disable protected mode with "protected-mode no" by
# adding it to this configuration file.
#
# Before doing that MAKE SURE the instance is protected from the outside
# world via firewalling or other means.
#
# For example you may use one of the following:
#
# bind 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.1
#
# protected-mode no
<% if @sentinel_bind %>
bind <%=@sentinel_bind%>
<% end %>

 <% if @protected_mode %>
<%= "protected-mode #{@protected_mode}" %>
<% end %>

# port <sentinel-port>
# The port that this sentinel instance will run on
port <%=@sentinel_port%>

# sentinel announce-ip <ip>
# sentinel announce-port <port>
#
# The above two configuration directives are useful in environments where,
# because of NAT, Sentinel is reachable from outside via a non-local address.
#
# When announce-ip is provided, the Sentinel will claim the specified IP address
# in HELLO messages used to gossip its presence, instead of auto-detecting the
# local address as it usually does.
#
# Similarly when announce-port is provided and is valid and non-zero, Sentinel
# will announce the specified TCP port.
#
# The two options don't need to be used together, if only announce-ip is
# provided, the Sentinel will announce the specified IP and the server port
# as specified by the "port" option. If only announce-port is provided, the
# Sentinel will announce the auto-detected local IP and the specified port.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel announce-ip 1.2.3.4
<%= "sentinel announce-ip #{@announce_ip}" unless @announce_ip.nil? %>
<%= "sentinel announce-port #{@announce_port}" unless @announce_port.nil? %>

# sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <redis-port> <quorum>
#
# Tells Sentinel to monitor this slave, and to consider it in O_DOWN
# (Objectively Down) state only if at least <quorum> sentinels agree.
#
# Note: master name should not include special characters or spaces.
# The valid charset is A-z 0-9 and the three characters ".-_".
# sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2

# sentinel auth-pass <master-name> <password>
#
# Set the password to use to authenticate with the master and slaves.
# Useful if there is a password set in the Redis instances to monitor.
#
# Note that the master password is also used for slaves, so it is not
# possible to set a different password in masters and slaves instances
# if you want to be able to monitor these instances with Sentinel.
#
# However you can have Redis instances without the authentication enabled
# mixed with Redis instances requiring the authentication (as long as the
# password set is the same for all the instances requiring the password) as
# the AUTH command will have no effect in Redis instances with authentication
# switched off.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel auth-pass mymaster MySUPER--secret-0123passw0rd

# sentinel down-after-milliseconds <master-name> <milliseconds>
#

# Down).
#

# sentinel parallel-syncs <master-name> <numslaves>
#
# How many slaves we can reconfigure to point to the new slave simultaneously
# during the failover. Use a low number if you use the slaves to serve query
# to avoid that all the slaves will be unreachable at about the same
# time while performing the synchronization with the master.

# sentinel failover-timeout <master-name> <milliseconds>
#
# Specifies the failover timeout in milliseconds. When this time has elapsed
# without any progress in the failover process, it is considered concluded by
# the sentinel even if not all the attached slaves were correctly configured
# to replicate with the new master (however a "best effort" SLAVEOF command
# is sent to all the slaves before).
#
# Also when 25% of this time has elapsed without any advancement, and there
# is a leader switch (the sentinel did not started the failover but is now
# elected as leader), the sentinel will continue the failover doing a
# "takeover".
#
# Default is 15 minutes.

# SCRIPTS EXECUTION
#
# sentinel notification-script and sentinel reconfig-script are used in order
# to configure scripts that are called to notify the system administrator
# or to reconfigure clients after a failover. The scripts are executed
# with the following rules for error handling:
#
# If script exists with "1" the execution is retried later (up to a maximum
# number of times currently set to 10).
#
# If script exists with "2" (or an higher value) the script execution is
# not retried.
#
# If script terminates because it receives a signal the behavior is the same
# as exit code 1.
#
# A script has a maximum running time of 60 seconds. After this limit is
# reached the script is terminated with a SIGKILL and the execution retried.

# NOTIFICATION SCRIPT
#
# sentinel notification-script <master-name> <script-path>
#
# Call the specified notification script for any sentienl event that is
# generated in the WARNING level (for instance -sdown, -odown, and so forth).
# This script should notify the system administrator via email, SMS, or any
# other messaging system, that there is something wrong with the monitored
# Redis systems.
#
# The script is called with just two arguments: the first is the event type
# and the second the event description.
#
# The script must exist and be executable in order for sentinel to start if
# this option is provided.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel notification-script mymaster /var/redis/notify.sh
<%= "sentinel notification-script #{@name} #{@notification_script}" unless @notification_script.nil? %>

# CLIENTS RECONFIGURATION SCRIPT
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script <master-name> <script-path>
#
# When the failover starts, ends, or is aborted, a script can be called in
# order to perform application-specific tasks to notify the clients that the
# configuration has changed and the master is at a different address.
#
# The script is called in the following cases:
#
# Failover started (a slave is already promoted)
# Failover finished (all the additional slaves already reconfigured)
# Failover aborted (in that case the script was previously called when the
#                   failover started, and now gets called again with swapped
#                   addresses).
#
# The following arguments are passed to the script:
#
# <master-name> <role> <state> <from-ip> <from-port> <to-ip> <to-port>
#
# <state> is "start", "end" or "abort"
# <role> is either "leader" or "observer"
#
# The arguments from-ip, from-port, to-ip, to-port are used to communicate
# the old address of the master and the new address of the elected slave
# (now a master) in the case state is "start" or "end".
#
# For abort instead the "from" is the address of the promoted slave and
# "to" is the address of the original master address, since the failover
# was aborted.
#
# This script should be resistant to multiple invocations.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script mymaster /var/redis/reconfig.sh
<%= "sentinel client-reconfig-script #{@name} #{@client_reconfig_script}" unless @client_reconfig_script.nil? %>
<% end %>
